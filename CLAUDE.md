## Overview

AshCommanded is an Elixir library that provides Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event-Sourcing (ES) patterns for the Ash Framework. It extends Ash resources with a Commanded DSL that enables defining commands, events, and projections.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Compile the project
mix compile

# Run all tests
mix test

# Run specific test file
mix test path/to/test_file.exs

# Run specific test with line number
mix test path/to/test_file.exs:42

# Run tests with coverage
mix test --cover
```

## Architecture

AshCommanded is built as a DSL extension for Ash Framework resources. Its main components are:

1. **DSL Extension**: The `AshCommanded.Commanded.Dsl` module defines four main sections:
   - `commands`: Define commands that trigger state changes
   - `events`: Define events that are emitted by commands
   - `projections`: Define how events affect the resource state
   - `application`: Configure Commanded application settings

2. **Code Generation**: The library dynamically generates Elixir modules:
   - Command modules (structs with typespecs)
   - Event modules (structs with typespecs)
   - Projection modules (with event handlers)
   - Projector modules (Commanded event handlers that apply projections)
   - Aggregate modules (for Commanded integration)
   - Router modules (for command dispatching)
   - Commanded application modules (with projector supervision)

3. **Transformers**: The DSL uses transformers to generate code:
   - `GenerateCommandModules`: Generates command structs.
   - `GenerateEventModules`: Generates event structs.
   - `GenerateProjectionModules`: Generates projection modules.
   - `GenerateProjectorModules`: Generates Commanded event handlers that process events.
   - `GenerateAggregateModule`: Generates aggregate module for Commanded.
   - `GenerateDomainRouterModule`: Generates router module for each domain.
   - `GenerateMainRouterModule`: Generates main application router.
   - `GenerateCommandedApplication`: Generates Commanded application with projector supervision.

4. **Verifiers**: Validate DSL usage:
   - `ValidateCommandActions`: ensures that each command refers to a valid action in the resource.
   - `ValidateCommandFields`:  Ensures that all fields declared in a command exist as attributes in the resource.
   - `ValidateCommandHandlers`: Ensures no two commands use the same handler function name within a resource.
   - `ValidateCommandNames`:  Ensures that each command name within a resource is unique.
   - `ValidateCommandNameConflict`: Ensures that command names do not shadow unrelated resource actions.
   - `ValidateEventFields`: Ensures that every field listed in each event exists as an attribute in the resource.
   - `ValidateEventNames`: Ensures that all event names are unique within a resource.
   - `ValidateProjectionActions`: Ensures that each projection references a valid action on the resource.
   - `ValidateProjectionChanges`: Ensures that each projection only updates known attributes.
   - `ValidateProjectionEvents`: Ensures that any projections refer to a valid event defined in the same resource.


## Usage Example

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshCommanded.Commanded.Dsl]

  commanded do
    commands do
      command :register_user do
        fields([:id, :email, :name])
        identity_field(:id)
      end
    end

    events do
      event :user_registered do
        fields([:id, :email, :name])
      end
    end

    projections do
      projection :user_registered do
        changes(%{status: :active})
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This will generate:
- `MyApp.Commands.RegisterUser` - Command struct
- `MyApp.Events.UserRegistered` - Event struct
- `MyApp.Projections.UserRegistered` - Projection definition
- `MyApp.Projectors.UserProjector` - Commanded event handler for projections
- `MyApp.UserAggregate` - Aggregate module
- `MyApp.Domain.Router` - Domain-specific router (if in an Ash.Domain)
- `AshCommanded.Router` - Main application router

## Documentation

AshCommanded provides comprehensive documentation that can be generated locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Generate cheatsheet and docs
mix gen.docs
```

The documentation includes:
- Guides for commands, events, projections, and routers
- API reference for all modules
- Cheatsheets for the DSL

## Commands

Commands define the actions that can be performed on your resources. AshCommanded generates command modules as structs with typespecs.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshCommanded.Commanded.Dsl]

  commanded do
    commands do
      # Basic command with required fields
      command :register_user do
        fields([:id, :email, :name])
        identity_field(:id)
      end
      
      # Command with custom name and disabled handler
      command :update_email do
        fields([:id, :email])
        command_name :ChangeUserEmail
        autogenerate_handler? false
      end
      
      # Command that maps to a specific Ash action
      command :deactivate do
        fields([:id])
        action :mark_inactive
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Generated command modules include:
- A struct with the specified fields
- Typespecs for all fields
- Standard module documentation

Example generated command:
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Commands.RegisterUser do
  @moduledoc """
  Command for registering a new user
  """
  
  @type t :: %__MODULE__{
    id: String.t(),
    email: String.t(),
    name: String.t()
  }
  
  defstruct [:id, :email, :name]
end
```

## Command Handlers

Command handlers are modules that process commands and apply business logic. AshCommanded generates handler modules that invoke Ash actions.

```elixir
defmodule AshCommanded.Commanded.CommandHandlers.UserHandler do
  @behaviour Commanded.Commands.Handler
  
  def handle(%MyApp.Commands.RegisterUser{} = cmd, _metadata) do
    Ash.run_action(MyApp.User, :register_user, Map.from_struct(cmd))
  end
  
  def handle(%MyApp.Commands.DeactivateUser{} = cmd, _metadata) do
    Ash.run_action(MyApp.User, :mark_inactive, Map.from_struct(cmd))
  end
end
```

Handler options:
- `handler_name` - Custom function name for the handler clause
- `action` - Specify a different Ash action to call (defaults to command name)
- `autogenerate_handler?` - Set to false to disable handler generation

## Events

Events represent facts that have occurred in your system. AshCommanded generates event modules as structs with typespecs.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshCommanded.Commanded.Dsl]

  commanded do
    events do
      # Basic event with fields
      event :user_registered do
        fields([:id, :email, :name])
      end
      
      # Event with custom module name
      event :email_changed do
        fields([:id, :email])
        event_name :UserEmailUpdated
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Generated event modules include:
- A struct with the specified fields
- Typespecs for all fields
- Standard module documentation

Example generated event:
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Events.UserRegistered do
  @moduledoc """
  Event emitted when a user is registered
  """
  
  @type t :: %__MODULE__{
    id: String.t(),
    email: String.t(),
    name: String.t()
  }
  
  defstruct [:id, :email, :name]
end
```

## Event Handlers (Aggregates)

Event handlers in the form of Aggregates process events and update state. AshCommanded generates aggregate modules for each resource.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.UserAggregate do
  defstruct [:id, :email, :name, :status]
  
  # Apply event to update the aggregate state
  def apply(%__MODULE__{} = state, %MyApp.Events.UserRegistered{} = event) do
    %__MODULE__{
      state |
      id: event.id,
      email: event.email,
      name: event.name
    }
  end
  
  def apply(%__MODULE__{} = state, %MyApp.Events.UserEmailUpdated{} = event) do
    %__MODULE__{state | email: event.email}
  end
end
```

The aggregate maintains the current state by applying events in sequence. Each event handler updates specific fields based on the event data.

## Projections

Projections define how events should update your read models. AshCommanded generates projection modules that handle specific event types.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.User do
  use Ash.Resource,
    extensions: [AshCommanded.Commanded.Dsl]

  commanded do
    projections do
      # Create a new record when user is registered
      projection :user_registered do
        action(:create)
        changes(%{
          status: "active",
          registered_at: &DateTime.utc_now/0
        })
      end
      
      # Update specific fields when email changes
      projection :email_changed do
        action(:update_by_id)
        changes(fn event ->
          %{
            email: event.email,
            updated_at: DateTime.utc_now()
          }
        end)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Projection options:
- `action` - The Ash action to perform (`:create`, `:update`, `:destroy`, etc.)
- `changes` - Static map or function that returns the changes to apply
- `autogenerate?` - Set to false to disable projection generation

## Router Usage

The generated routers allow dispatching commands to their appropriate handlers:

```elixir
# Dispatch a command through the main router
command = %MyApp.Commands.RegisterUser{id: "123", email: "user@example.com", name: "Test User"}
AshCommanded.Router.dispatch(command)
```

## Commanded Application

The `application` section in the DSL allows configuring a Commanded application at the domain level:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Domain do
  use Ash.Domain

  resources do
    resource MyApp.User
  end

  commanded do
    application do
      otp_app :my_app
      event_store Commanded.EventStore.Adapters.InMemory
      include_supervisor? true
    end
  end
end
```

This generates a Commanded application module that:
- Configures the event store and other Commanded settings
- Includes the domain router
- Provides a supervisor for all projectors
- Can be added to your application's supervision tree

## Projectors

Projectors are Commanded event handlers that listen for domain events and update read models. AshCommanded automatically generates projector modules using the `GenerateProjectorModules` transformer. These projectors:

1. Subscribe to specific event types defined in your resource
2. Process events using the Commanded event handling system
3. Apply changes to your resources via Ash actions (create, update, destroy)

For example, a generated projector might look like:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Projectors.UserProjector do
  use Commanded.Projections.Ecto, name: "MyApp.Projectors.UserProjector"

  project(%MyApp.Events.UserRegistered{} = event, _metadata, fn _context ->
    Ash.Changeset.new(MyApp.User, event)
    |> Ash.Changeset.for_action(:create, %{status: "active"})
    |> Ash.create()
  end)
  
  # Functions to apply different action types
  defp apply_action_fn(:create), do: &Ash.create/1
  defp apply_action_fn(:update), do: &Ash.update/1
  defp apply_action_fn(:destroy), do: &Ash.destroy/1
end
```

You can customize the projector name with the `projector_name` option or disable automatic generation with `autogenerate?: false`.
